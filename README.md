Atliq Hospitality Data Analysis

This is the Project done during my Internship.
 
 Let me provide you with some details about the Atliq Hospitality project.

Atliq Grands is a five-star hotel chain operating in four cities: Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. They have a total of seven properties, each categorized under different names:

Atliq Bay
Atliq Blu
Atliq City
Atliq Exotica
Atliq Grands
Atliq Palace
Atliq Seasons
The rooms in these properties are further divided into four categories: Elite, Premium, Presidential, and Standard. Additionally, there are six main platforms for booking rooms, along with some other less effective platforms12.

The project involved analyzing comprehensive data related to hotels, rooms, and bookings. The goal was to provide insights and facilitate decision-making in the hospitality industry. The interactive Power BI dashboard created for Atliq Grands allows them to:

Track Revenue & Guest Sentiment: Gain insights into revenue trends and guest feedback across properties.
Optimize Occupancy: Analyze occupancy patterns by day type and booking platforms for strategic resource allocation.
Benchmark Performance: Compare their performance with competitors to inform pricing and service adjustments.


Through data-driven decision-making, Atliq Grands can boost revenue, enhance guest experiences, and optimize operations based on occupancy trends and booking patterns1. The project demonstrates the power of data visualization in transforming the hospitality industry.
